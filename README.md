### New mechanics, keywords and etc. ###
* **Rise**: cards with this keyword will improve with every turn!
* **Rorschach stain**: This is a special set of cards, each of the cards has a unique property, but all cards automatically play itself when drawn, then draw a card and Exhaust.

### Arts ###
As images for cards I took pictures from the Internet, I think it will not be a problem, it`s all because I am a very poor artist üôà.

### Conclusion ###
There is a whole mountain of ideas that I will try to implement (events, monsters, bosses). If you find a bug or have a suggestion for a balance, write them in the issues section.
Thanks to everyone who will play this mod. Also mod is fully translated into Russian, —Ç–∞–∫ —á—Ç–æ, –¥–æ–±—Ä–æ –ø–æ–∂–∞–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞ –±–æ—Ä—Ç, –≥–æ—Å–ø–æ–¥–∞.
